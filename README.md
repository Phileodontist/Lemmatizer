# Lemmatizer
Rule-based Lemmatizer

# Summary
As my first natural language processing project, I decided to go with something that I thought I was capable of doing at the current time I started this project. Knowing very little about the complexity behind the process of lemmatizing, or in processing natural language over all, I chose to go with a method that was the most simplest, a rule-based one. In the end, the results came out to be quite adequate, accomplishing what I originally intended.
