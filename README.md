# Lemmatizer
Rule-based Lemmatizer

## Date: Jan 2017

# Summary
As my first natural language processing project, I decided to go with something that I thought I was capable of doing at the current time I started this project. Knowing very little about the complexity behind the process of lemmatizing, or in processing natural language over all, I chose to go with a method that was the most simplest, a rule-based one. In the end, the results came out to be quite crude where not all affixes are covered, due in part to the vastness of English's morphology, however I was satisfied with what I've covered so far (a very basic coverage of the common suffixes in English). As in right now, this current project is unfinished and would most likely not be revisited. If it were to be revisited, I will definitely overhaul the entire project to match my current skill set.
  
* Example:  (Original) I jumped over two dogs, and almost fell while haphazardly landing on both of my feet.
*   (Lemmatized form) I jump over two dog, and almost fell while haphazard land on both of my feet.
